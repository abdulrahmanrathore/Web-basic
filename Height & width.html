        Bubble sort is one of the easiest sorting techniques in programming and it is very simple to implement. It just simply compares the current element with the next element and swaps it, if it is greater or less, depending on the condition. It gives quite accurate results. Each time an element is compared with all other elements till it’s final place is found is called a pass.
